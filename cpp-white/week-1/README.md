# 1st week

## Context

Although I say it is 1st week, contents of the 1st week are fairly easy as well the whole white belt is extremely easy. I completed 
the white belt in the span of 10 days, therefore calling it 1st week may be little bit missleading.

Lecture notes are in Russian.

## Contents of 1st week

### Introduction to the course, intro to C++, installing IDE, etc
nothing to add here
### 1st problem of the course: A+B
Yes, the first problem you solve here is A+B, not the famous Hello World. I will upload my solution as I promised, but it is nothing
groundbreaking.
### Problem "Minimal string"
This is yet another easy problem: you need to find lexographic minimum of 3 strings of the length less than or equal 30 symbols
### Problem "Equation"
Find all solutions of Ax<sup>2</sup> + Bx + C = 0
### Problem "Division"
Find integer division of A on B
### Problem "Cost computation"
Find the cost of the product with a conditional discount
### Problem "Even numbers"
Find all even numbers between given two integer numbers
### Problem "Second coming"
Find when the given symbol appears in the given string for the 2nd time
### Problem GCD
Finding greatest common divisor. I already solved this problem when I studied C++ on my own, therefore this problem will have more
things to it (finding x,y s.t. ax+by=1) than the course wanted
### Binary numbers
Find binary form of the integer number (I assume given in base 10 counting system)
