# About C++ White belt

The course "C++: white belt" is the 1st of 5 courses of the specialization "Basics of development on C++" and therefore it is very
introductory. Nevertheless it was very useful course that taught me many important details I failed to grasp when I tried to study
C++ on my on from free youtube tutorials.

## What will be here

I already completed the course. I plan to upload all the lectures I received and all the problems I solved and their solutions (from me
and official solutions too). Possibly I will add some notes explaining my thought process. Sadly, I created this repo after I completed
the course, so I will probably not be able to share my exact thoughts during the process of solving the problems.

## Current progress

Uploaded all problems of the week 1 (in the name only; week 1 is easily doable in a span of a day).

Currently adding the week 2.
