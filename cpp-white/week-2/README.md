# 2nd week

## Contents

Functions and containers. Introduction

### Lecture notes: Functions

You can access the lecture notes in russian in the file called "Lecture notes week 2 -- Functions.pdf" in the same folder and if you
want to read my 5 cents about the lecture you can read them in "Lecture notes my comments.md".
### Problem set: Functions

#### Problem factorial

Write a function which computes factorial of a non-negative integer.

#### Problem palindrome

Write a function which checks whether the word is a palindrome.

#### Problem palindrome filter

Write a function which receives `vector<string> words` and `int minLength` and returns all palindrome strings of the length no less than
minLength.

#### Problem maximizator

Write a function which receives two integer parameters and if the first is bigger than the second, change the second to have a value of
the first parameter.

#### Problem moving strings

Write a function which receives two vectors of strings source and destination, and moves every string from source to destination. 

#### Problem reverse the sequence

Write a function `void Reverse(vector<int>& v)` which will reverse the order in a vector v.

#### Problem reverse the sequence 2

Write a function `vector<int> Reversed(const vector<int>& v)` which will return the reversed copy of a vector v.

### Lecture notes: Container vector

You can read what the lecture notes covered in russian in the file "Lecture notes week 2 -- Vectors, Maps, Sets.pdf" and my comments in
"Lecture notes my comments.md".

### Problem set: Container vector

#### Problem average temperature

Given a recordings of the temperature for several days find the days which are hotter than the average temperature.

#### Problem queue

You have to simulate a queue which doesn't advance but people can come or leave the queue from the end. Also some people can become
worried or calm down (see details on problem's README file).

#### Problem monthly activity

You have to simulate a journal of things you have to do every month. For e.g. paying for water or for the Internet: if you have to pay
for your Internet on 3rd date of the month, then you have to pay for Internet 3rd date of every month. So you have to simulate
an interactive journal where you can add specific task on a specific day of the month, print all the tasks of the specific day, and 
change the month for the next (see details on problem's README file).

### Lecture notes: Container map

You can read what the lecture notes covered in russian in the file "Lecture notes week 2 -- Vectors, Maps, Sets.pdf" and my comments in
"Lecture notes my comments.md".

### Problem set: Container map

#### Problem anagramms

Check if two words are anagramms of each other.

#### Problem book of country capitals

Simulate an interactive book who stores capital's of countries. It should be able to process a few requests like changing a capital of the
country or changing a name of the country, also requests to print a current capital of certain country or printing all the countries
in the book with their capitals (see details on problem's README file).

#### Problem Bus Stops 1

Simulate an interactive system of storing bus routes. It should  be able to process a few requests like introducing a new route, finding
all the bus routes that passes through a certain bus stop and, vice versa, finding all the stops of a certain bus route and printing all
the bus routes in the system (see details on problem's README file).

#### Problem Bus Stops 2

In this problem you have to numerate bus routes: first route should receive the number 1, the second route should receive the number 2
etc. If certain bus route already has a number, then instead you should print the number of the route 
(see details on problem's README file). 

### Lecture notes: Container set

You can read what the lecture notes covered in russian in the file "Lecture notes week 2 -- Vectors, Maps, Sets.pdf" and my comments in
"Lecture notes my comments.md".

### Problem set: Container set

#### Problem number of unique strings

Given strings find the number of unique strings among them.

#### Problem set of values of the map

Write a function which receives `map<int, string>` object as a parameter and returns the set of values of this map.

#### Problem synonyms

Simulate an interactive dictionary of synonyms which can add a pair of words as synonyms, find the number of synonyms of a certian word
and check whether two given words are synonyms or not.

#### Problem Bus Stops 3

_What a trilogy!_ The same as Problem "Bus Stops 2" with difference in a small detail (see in respective README file).
