Functions and containers. Introduction

### Lecture notes: Functions

You can access the lecture notes in russian in the file called "Lecture notes week 2 -- Functions.pdf" in the same folder and if you
want to read my 5 cents about the lecture you can read them in "Lecture notes my comments.md" (for now it has only about functions; will
be updating it, tho).

### Problem set: Functions

#### Problem factorial

Write a function which computes factorial of a non-negative integer.

#### Problem palindrom

Write a function which checks whether the word is a palindrom

#### Problem palindrom filter

Write a function which receives `vector<string>` words and int minLength and returns all palindrom strings of the length no less than
minLength.

#### Problem maximizator

Write a function which receives two integer parameters and if the first is bigger than the second, change the second to have a value of
the first parameter.

#### Problem moving strings

Write a function which receives two vectors of strings source and destination, and moves every string from source to destination. 

#### Problem reverse the sequence

Write a function `void Reverse(vector<int>& v)` which will reverse the order in a vector v.

#### Problem reverse the sequence 2

Write a function `vector<int> Reversed(const vector<int>& v)` which will return the reversed copy of a vector v.
