# Problem description

Write a function `void Reverse(vector<int>& v)` which will reverse the order in a vector v.

## Example
```C++
vector<int> numbers = {1, 5, 3, 4, 2};
Reverse(numbers);
// numbers should be equal to {2, 4, 3, 5, 1}
```
## Explanations

### The problem

Nothing to explain here.

### My solution

Just iterate through the vector using standard for loop till the half of the vector and swap corresponding elements.

### Official solution

Absolutely the same as mine.
