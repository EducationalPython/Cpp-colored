#WELCOME to my C++ Git repo

This is where I plan to store all the files related to my education of C++

##About me

My name is not important, although I might add it later if I ever will use this github account for some official purposes;
for now I prefer to stay anonymous.

##C++ education

I will upload all the code pieces related to me studying C++. For now it will mainly consist of the solutions to the problem
from the course I am studying. I am currently studying the russian course on C++ called "Basics of development on C++: **color** belt"
where **color** is one of the colors -- white, yellow, red, brown or black. It is well known course formerly available on Coursera,
although I am studying it on Stepik. Its creators are former Yandex employees and in the past course was affilated with Yandex & MIPT.
I am not aware if it has any affilations nowadays.

Possibly, I will upload my solutions from other courses and contests I partake in.

##Current progress
I already finished the C++ white belt before I remembered that I have GitHub and that I should learn to use it and currently I am studying
the yellow belt. More to come.
